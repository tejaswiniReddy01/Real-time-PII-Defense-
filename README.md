Deployment Proposal for PII Detection Solution
Overview

The solution detects and redacts Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as phone numbers, Aadhaar, passport, UPI IDs, names, emails, and addresses.
It masks sensitive data in output while keeping it structured enough for analysis and reporting.

Deployment Strategy – API Gateway Plugin
Layer of Operation

The plugin runs at the API Gateway layer.

It scans incoming and outgoing API traffic, detecting and masking PII before requests reach backend services.

This ensures sensitive data never enters internal systems unprotected.

Scalability

Works across multiple APIs without changing each individual service.

Scaling is simple—only the gateway needs to be updated, not all microservices.

Latency

Lightweight redaction rules mean processing happens in real-time.

Because detection happens at the gateway, latency is minimal and user experience remains smooth.

Cost-effectiveness

No need to modify backend applications or build extra infrastructure.

Centralized plugin reduces duplication of effort across services.

Ease of Integration

Easy to plug into existing API gateways (e.g., Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway, NGINX).

Does not require application teams to rewrite their code.

Redaction rules can be updated centrally and applied to all services instantly.

Justification

Keeps PII safe before it enters downstream services or databases.

Ensures compliance with privacy laws (like GDPR, HIPAA).

Reduces operational cost by managing redaction in a single layer.

Provides consistent masking across all services and APIs.

Summary

Deploying the PII Detection Solution as an API Gateway plugin ensures:

Centralized and consistent PII masking

Minimal latency with no backend changes

Scalable, cost-effective, and simple to integrate

This makes it a practical and reliable strategy for organizations handling sensitive user data.
